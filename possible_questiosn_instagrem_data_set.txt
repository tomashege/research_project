Fake news, misinformation and rumors spreading:. Several researcher have started to inspect COVID-19 misinformation. As an example, an infodemic observatory have analyzed more than 100M public messages to understand the digital response in online social media to COVID-19 outbreak.https://covid19obs.fbk.eu In another study, Sharma et al. [5] made a public dashboard available summarising data from real-time tweets in in https://usc-melady.github.io/COVID-19-Tweet-Analysis/ with a focus to misinformation spread analysis. We believe that our Instagram data could be used to evaluate the flow of misinformation (e.g. memes) on Instagram.
2) Bot Population and bot generated content: It is well known that bot content plays a prominent role in social media data [20]. These have the capacity of amplify misinformation or even act against public health policies (e.g. encourgaging a breakdown in social distancing). We posit that the data could be used to explore the role of bots in this dissemination.
3) Behavioral change analysis during the pandemic: The social distancing measures are created an unprecedented change to millions of people’s lives. Understanding the behavioral consequences of this is vital for understand- ing things like adherence to social distancing policies and mental health consequences.
4) Information sharing related Covid-19: Information flow is vital during periods of emergency. We posit that the dataset can be used to understand the flow of informa- tion, as well as people’s reactions to such information.
